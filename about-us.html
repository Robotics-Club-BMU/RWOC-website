                ROBOTICS WINTER OF CODE
            </h1>
            <p class="about_us-content">
                For the first time in BMU, Robotics Club had a thought of getting into opensource. 
                This idea to work is Robotics Winter of Code. 
                This is an event for promoting opensource culture, which is one week long, where students will be working on different projects, with the help of project mentors. 
                All the projects need to embed different domains such as openCV, web development, arduino, machine learning etc, into the field of robotics. 
                Finally, the best contributors get the prize money.
